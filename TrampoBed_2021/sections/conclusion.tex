Main findings
% This research shows that athletes could gain in performance by incorporating 3D motions to their techniques, especially by moving their segments in the best tilting plane (i.e., plane formed by the twist and angular momentum axes).
% We provided three innovative and simple 3D arm techniques for a triple twist backward somersault robust to kinematic perturbations. 
% The selected 3D arm techniques were less complex, required less efforts and had better potential for landing than the equivalent 2D technique, establishing the superiority of 3D arm techniques.
% With the comprehension brought by this work, coaches could better guide their future athletes throughout the learning of 3D arm techniques.
