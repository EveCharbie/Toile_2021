% The main objective of this study was to generate and analyze innovative and robust twisting techniques to highlight arm strategies that trampolinists could integrate into their practice.
% The main findings are that \textit{(i)} aerial twist performance is linearly correlated to the complexity of arm trajectories, \textit{(ii)} moving the arms in the so-called ``\textit{best tilting plane}'' is an efficient strategy to generate twist rotation and \textit{(iii)} for similar twist performance, 3D techniques are simpler and require less efforts than 2D techniques.
